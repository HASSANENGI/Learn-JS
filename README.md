# Download & Install Cursor AI
While you can use VS Code, I recommend installing Cursor AI, which is similar to VS Code but with AI-powered features to enhance your coding experience.

# Download & Install Node js
To run JavaScript outside the browser, Node.js is required.

# Hello World
Letâ€™s get started by running your first JavaScript code!

1. Open Cursor AI.

2. Create a new folder.

3. Inside the folder, create a new file named index.js.

3. Write the following code in index.js:

```javascript
   console.log('Hello, World!');

```

5. Open the terminal (or press Ctrl+Shift+).

6. Run the following command in the terminal:
   
```javascript
   node index.js;
```

You should see 'Hello World' printed in the terminal.
   
Congratulations! You've just run your first JavaScript code!

ðŸ“¥ **Clone the Repo**

Now, clone this repository to your local machine (you can find tutorials on YouTube if you need help with cloning a repo).

For each step, open the respective file, and run it in the terminal using the command:

```
   node <filename.js>
```

Replace <filename.js> with the actual file name.

Remember, consistency is key. Donâ€™t give upâ€”keep practicing, and you'll be a JavaScript pro in no time. Thanks for learning with us!
